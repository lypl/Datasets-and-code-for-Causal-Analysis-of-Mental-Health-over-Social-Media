# Overview

Software includes three folders containing the code for the classifier, the code for the redundancy detector and the templates generated by t5. 

# Installation

1. Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install environments.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. The detector code needs to be installed and then run. Running commands as follows under the directory "Software/detector".

```bash
cd Software/detector
python -m pip install .
```

# Runing
To do data augmentation under directory "Software/detector/a2t/redundancy":
```bash
python process_data.py
python get_nli_dataset_zero_shot.py
python process_test_data.py
python predict_boosting.py {template_num} {cuda_id}
python filt_document_to_new_dataset.py
```
To run classification under directory "Software/classifier/scripts":
```bash
bash sample0.sh
```
